   ------------------------HTML-------------------------- 
  
   Html is a hyper text markup language.
   in this language  we not only write simple text and also we can write hyper text that means the text acts as link ex:anchor tag.

   in Html <> this is open tag and </> this end tag. and <></> this hole combined thing is called element.
   ex:
   <div></div>  element
   <div style="color:red;">hello hi</div> here style is attribute and color is property and red is value.the text between the open tag and end tag is called inner html.

   the elements are seperated into two kinds they are;
   1.block level elements 
   2.inline elements


   1.block level elements
      .these elements starts in a new line and take full page width.
      .we can set width,height eventhrough it can take full page width.
   
      ex:h1,p,div,ul,ol.

   2.inline elements
     . these elements have fixed width and height based on content.
     . we can set width,height but it can't change.
    
     ex:input,button,img,a,span.
